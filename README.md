#### Two Sanity Checks Performed

**Sanity Check 1: Full Memorization**
- **Objective**: Model learns to generate complete sentence from empty prompt
- **Loss Computation**: All tokens (complete sequence learning)
- **Expected Result**: Perfect memorization with near-zero loss

**Sanity Check 2: Masked Learning**  
- **Objective**: Model learns to complete sentence after "I l"

- **Status**:  **SUCCESS** - Perfect memorization achieved

**Sample Generation Results**:
```
Prompt: "" (empty) → "I love machine learning"
Prompt: "I" → " love machine learning"  
Prompt: "I love" → " machine learning"
```

**Analysis**: Model successfully memorized the target sentence with deterministic generation across multiple attempts.


#### Sanity Check 2: Masked Learning

- **Final Training Loss**: 0.000009 (near machine precision)
